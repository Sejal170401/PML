Random Forest algorithm performed better than Decision Trees.
Accuracy for Random Forest model was 0.995 (95% CI: (0.993, 0.997)) compared to Decision Tree model with 0.739 (95% CI: (0.727, 0.752)). 
The Random Forests model is choosen. The expected out-of-sample error is estimated at 0.005, or 0.5%.
